3.	Project description
Assessing correlations between vaccine rollout, stock performance and larger impact on countries.
Objective 1: Analyzing correlation between vaccine rollout, stock performance (each vaccine) and larger impact on countries
Objective 2: Global Vaccine Rollout and its Impact on Stock Markets, Economies, and Public Health"


4.	Research Questions to answer

4.1.	Determine which stock was the best to invest in
4.2.	Rollout of these different vaccines per country
4.3.	Is there a correlation between the vaccine rollout and the change in economy of different countries throughout this timeframe (developing, developed, transitioning government)?
4.4.	How many covid related deaths were reported throughout the pandemic and is there a correlation to the vaccine rollout?

5.	Plan
The first aim is to compare the performance of stocks of  major vaccine companies throughout key points of the pandemic.  In doing so, we will make an analysis of this data in order to determine which stock was the best to invest in. 

The second aim is to assess the rollout of these different vaccines per country - this data will be used to make correlations at later points. 

The third aim is to analyze whether or not there is a correlation between vaccine rollout/vaccination rates and changes in the economies of these countries : One of the stated goals of the vaccines was to help once again boost economies so this section aims to analyze whether or not there truly is a correlation there. 

Finally, we will use that same vaccine rollout data to determine if there is a correlation between vaccination rates and rates of covid-related deaths. Both analyses will feed into the predicted strength of the stocks.

6.	Possible datasets
6.1.	Aim 1 -Stocks related to vaccines - Google Finances,Yahoo Finances
6.2.	Aim 2 - Johns Hopkins University: They have been tracking COVID-19 data, including vaccination statistics, which can be accessed through their GitHub repository.
6.3.	Aim 3 - Resources from aim 2 additionally to World Bank data API
6.4.	Aim 4 -Johns Hopkins University: They have been tracking COVID-19 data, including vaccination statistics, which can be accessed through their GitHub repository.

7.	Possible Blockers and how you plan to solve them 
-	Availability of data
-	Consistency of the data between different sources

8.	A possible blocker can be identifying which countries are considered countries
We plan to solve this by having a set number of countries.

1) COLLECT THE DATA

    1.1) Vaccine- Stock Data

        collected stock market data related to vaccine companies using the open-source library yfinance, which provides access to market data from Yahoo! Finance's API.

        --Extracting Data using yfinance library of Python -
    
            Define the ticker for Pfizer
            ticker = 'PFE'  # Pfizer
            Fetch data for Pfizer from yfinance
            start_date = '2019-01-01'
            end_date = '2023-12-31'
            Download the data for Pfizer
            pfizer_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
            Add a Ticker column
            pfizer_data['Ticker'] = ticker
            Reset index to make Date a column
            pfizer_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
            Save the data to a CSV file
            pfizer_data.to_csv('Resources/PFE_data.csv', index=False)
            Display a summary of the data
            print(pfizer_data.head())


            -merging:
                A csv file -containing the data for all vaccines 

            - cleaning : 
                 - create DataFrame : combined_df
                 - check for missing values drop duplicate columns
                 - Check the format for -Date column
                 - Identify potential Outliers
                 - drop NAN rows


2) PROCESS THE DATA
 transformation and analyses

    2.1) Calculate Yearly Change in Stocks Performace for each Vaccine(2019-2023)
        -groupby'Ticker'
        -reset index
        -Calculate-Percenatge change
        -new Column added percentage change
        -function to calculate base 100

4.2.	QUESTION 2 - STUDYING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN VACCINE ROLLOUT OF INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS AND THE STOCK VOLUME OF THEIR COMPANIES.
       (https://github.com/nazimben25/project1_group2/tree/main/Ahmad-project)

Output - linear regression graph and associated r-value allowing us to draw a conclusion on whether or not there is in fact a strong correlation between the two. In other words, whether or not it can be said statistically that as number of vaccines purchased by governments from a particular manufacturer increases, so does the stock volume of the company.

    0.2) module importation

        import pandas as pd
        from pathlib import Path
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import time
        import scipy.stats as st
        from scipy.stats import linregress
        
1) Data Collection

        Data was collected from Our World in Data (owid) covid-19-data Github repository, specifically the file vaccinations-by-manufacturers.csv in the vaccinations folder - https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data.git

        The Stock Volume dataset was generated via a particular code provided by my teammate Muskan, highlighted in section 2.2

2) Data processing and cleaning

    2.1) Data was loaded as per the following path:

    2.2) Cleaning the vaccinations dataset: the last column was renamed for a more visually appealing table - manufacturer_data_cleaned = manufacturer_data.rename(columns={"total_vaccinations": "Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer"})

    2.3) Cleaning the regions dataset: only the two necessary columns were kept - columns_kept = ["name", "region"]
    regions_df_cleaned = regions_df[columns_kept]
    regions_df_refined = regions_df_cleaned.rename(columns={"name": "location"}

    2.4) Once cleaned, the two datasets were merged and exported as a single csv file to use for the next step, which is visualization -
    merged_manufacturer_df = pd.merge(regions_df_refined, manufacturer_data_cleaned, on="location")
    manufacturer_path = "Output/merged_manufacturer_df.csv"
    merged_manufacturer_df.to_csv(manufacturer_path)

3) Analysis and visualizations:

    3.1) Individual bar graphs were produced for every region displaying the total vaccinations per manufacturer in that region. The graph displayed all of the manufacturers per region.
    -Firstly, a function was defined in order to only have to repear the function for each region rather than the whole code - def region_per_manufacturer_bar_chart(manufacturers_df, region_name, color='b')
    -Secondly, the maximum/final value for each manufacturer was collected for each country as the data is cumulative day by day - max_vaccinations = manufacturers_df.groupby(['location', 'region', 'vaccine'])['Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer'].max().reset_index().
    -Thirdly, the maximum values per manufacturer for each country were summed for their respective regions in order to get the totals - region_df = max_vaccinations[max_vaccinations["region"] == region_name]
    grouped_data = region_df.groupby('vaccine')['Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer'].sum().reset_index().
    -Fourthly, the data was plotted.
    -Finally, this line of code was repeated for each region, generating the bar graphs - region_per_manufacturer_bar_chart(manufacturers_df, "Latin America and Caribbean", 'b')

    3.2) A summary bar graph was generated to display the top 2 manufacturers per region in one graph as this will be what is used for the linear regression.
    -Thefirst two steps were the same as for 3.1.
    -The third step was also like 3.1 but with different code specifying only the top 2 manufacturers - top_manufacturers = region_manufacturer_data.groupby('region').apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(2, 'Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer')).reset_index(drop=True)
    -This code generated unique bar colors for each manufacturer to associate with the legend - nique_vaccines = top_manufacturers['vaccine'].unique()
    colors = plt.cm.get_cmap('tab10', len(unique_vaccines))  # Using a colormap for distinct colors
    color_mapping = {vaccine: colors(i) for i, vaccine in enumerate(unique_vaccines)}

    3.3) The code provided by my teammate Muskan allowed to get the Stock Volumes for each company.

    3.4) The top_manufacturers dataset from 3.2 was modified to have commonality with the stock volumes dataset - the company names were changed to ticker stock symbols and the "vaccine" column was renamed to "Ticker".

    3.5) The linear regression was generated, analyzing the correlation between total vaccinations of the top manufacturers and stock volumes of their companies - slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(merged_top_manufacturer_df["Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer"], merged_top_manufacturer_df["Volume"])
    regression_line = slope * merged_top_manufacturer_df["Total Vaccinations per Manufacturer"] + intercept
    line_eq = "y = " + str(round(slope,2)) + "x +" + str(round(intercept,2)).



4.3.	Is there a correlation between the vaccine rollout and the change in economy of different countries throughout this timeframe (developing, developed, transitioning government)?

5.	Plan
The first aim is to compare the performance of stocks of  major vaccine companies throughout key points of the pandemic.  In doing so, we will make an analysis of this data in order to determine which stock was the best to invest in. 

The second aim is to assess the rollout of these different vaccines per country - this data will be used to make correlations at later points. 

The third aim is to analyze whether or not there is a correlation between vaccine rollout/vaccination rates and changes in the economies of these countries : One of the stated goals of the vaccines was to help once again boost economies so this section aims to analyze whether or not there truly is a correlation there. 

Finally, we will use that same vaccine rollout data to determine if there is a correlation between vaccination rates and rates of covid-related deaths. Both analyses will feed into the predicted strength of the stocks.

6.	Possible datasets
6.1.	Aim 1 -Stocks related to vaccines - Google Finances,Yahoo Finances
6.2.	Aim 2 - Johns Hopkins University: They have been tracking COVID-19 data, including vaccination statistics, which can be accessed through their GitHub repository.
6.3.	Aim 3 - Resources from aim 2 additionally to World Bank data API
6.4.	Aim 4 -Johns Hopkins University: They have been tracking COVID-19 data, including vaccination statistics, which can be accessed through their GitHub repository.

7.	Possible Blockers and how you plan to solve them 
-	Availability of data
-	Consistency of the data between different sources

8.	A possible blocker can be identifying which countries are considered countries
We plan to solve this by having a set number of countries.
